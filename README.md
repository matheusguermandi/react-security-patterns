# React security patterns

This project focuses on implementing secure and efficient authentication strategies for web applications using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

## Implementations

### Refreshing jwt token

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provide a stateless and secure way to manage user authentication. The project implements a token-based authentication system with a focus on token refreshing.

Key Features

- Token Generation: Upon successful login, a JWT is generated and sent to the client.
- Token Storage: The JWT is securely stored on the client side (e.g., in local storage).
- Token Expiry: Tokens have a defined expiration time.
- Token Refresh: A refresh token is used to obtain a new JWT without requiring the user to log in again.

Implementation Highlights

- Token Expiration Handling: The frontend checks the token expiration and initiates a token refresh when needed.
- Secure Storage: JWTs are stored on the client side(localStorage) to prevent unauthorized access.
