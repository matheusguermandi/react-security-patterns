# React security patterns

This project focuses on implementing secure and efficient authentication strategies for web applications using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

## Implementations

### Refreshing jwt token

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provide a stateless and secure way to manage user authentication. The project implements a token-based authentication system with a focus on token refreshing.

Key Features

- Token Generation: Upon successful login, a JWT is generated and sent to the client.
- Token Storage: The JWT is securely stored on the client side (e.g., in local storage).
- Token Expiry: Tokens have a defined expiration time.
- Token Refresh: A refresh token is used to obtain a new JWT without requiring the user to log in again.

Implementation Highlights

- Token Expiration Handling: The frontend checks the token expiration and initiates a token refresh when needed.
- Secure Storage: JWTs are stored on the client side(localStorage) to prevent unauthorized access.

### Cookies and sessions

This method relies on Express.js middleware to manage user authentication using cookies and sessions. The following libraries are utilized:

- express-session: Express.js middleware for managing sessions.
- cookie-parser: Middleware to parse cookies attached to the client's request.
- csurf: Library for handling Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- session-file-store: A session store implementation for storing session data in files.

Libraries and How They Work Together

- express-session: Manages user sessions by creating a unique session identifier stored as a cookie on the client side. Session data is stored server-side, allowing for secure session management.

- cookie-parser: Parses cookies attached to the client's request, making cookie data accessible in the backend for authentication and session handling.

- csurf: Provides CSRF protection by generating and verifying unique tokens for each client request. This prevents unauthorized actions by ensuring that requests originate from the same application.

- session-file-store: A session store implementation that stores session data in files on the server. This ensures persistent session data even if the server restarts.

Implementation Highlights

- Middleware Integration: The project integrates these libraries seamlessly into the Express.js middleware stack to handle authentication and session management.
- CSRF Protection: Requests are validated for CSRF protection using tokens generated and verified by csurf.
- Secure Session Storage: Session data is securely stored using session-file-store, providing durability and reliability.
